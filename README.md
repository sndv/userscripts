# Userscripts

To install any of the listed userscripts first install a userscript manager,
for example [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) and then use the
**Install** links bellow.

## Allow Imgur SingleFile download

[Install](https://github.com/sndv/userscripts/raw/master/scripts/allow-imgur-singlepage-download.user.js)

Allow downloading an entire Imgur album page using the
[SingeFile](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile) browser extesion.

Normally Imgur removes images which are out of view and using SingleFile
results in a download that only contains a few images. This userscript fixes
this by keeping a visible copy of all images. Scrolling through the page before
triggering SingleFile is sometimes needed to load all images.

## Hide EdClub keyboard plugin

[Install](https://github.com/sndv/userscripts/raw/master/scripts/hide-edclub-keyboard-plugin.user.js)

Hide the on-screen keyboard during typing practice on EdClub/TypingClub.

## Skip bg-mamma redirects

[Install](https://github.com/sndv/userscripts/raw/master/scripts/skip-bgmamma-redirects.user.js)

Links posted on `bg-mamma.com` are automatically overwritten to redirect
through a tracking site or to add unwanted coupon codes. This script fixes all
links to go directly to their destination.

## No iherb codes in links

[Install](https://github.com/sndv/userscripts/raw/master/scripts/no-iherb-codes-in-links.user.js)

Remove any promotion and coupon codes from `iherb.com` links.
